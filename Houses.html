            <h1>Fire Emblem Three Houses Review</h1>
            <h2>Three Times the Houses, Three Times the Fun</h2>
            
        </header>
            <p><img src="three1.png" width="620" height"349"></p>
            <p>Give or take the two Radiance games the Fire Emblem franchise has mainly been a handheld exclusive its entire run, 
            that's why when it made its first main entry on a home console in over 15 years it used the opportunity to go all out. 
            Three entire campaigns modes, an entire base and time system, more combat options,
            and pretty much the entire game is fully voice acted with a fantastic set of characters and a dramatic story to go with it.</p>

            <p>For the first time of the main franchise, the entire game's in 3D as opposed to spirtes. 
            If you want, you can enable a mode that lets you physically see units actually move around the map while they're going at it, and the maps do tend to look decent as well. 
            Although it can be a bit tough to survey the entire map like this.</p>
            

            <h1>Strategy is Everything Here</h1>
            
           <p>In this game all of your choices matter, from which of the game's 3 routes you choose, to which of the game's cast you bring and what and how they do is also up to you. 
               Picking the right weapons and skills for the right people is a big part of the fun. It all matters too, because of you have it enabled, your units can permenant die. 
               You can turn back time to undo any immediate mistakes, but this power isn't infinite.</p>
            
            <p>There's also an addition element here: teaching your students (more on that in a bit). Barrowing <i>Persona's</i> everyday life system, how you spend your month before the next big battle is up to you.
            You can try teaching your units to be more proficient in their weapons, spend time with them, do smaller battles to earn more skills, or try to earn some cash for new weapons and items.</p>

            <h1>Not Much to Do If You're on Your Own</h1>
            <p>This is all well and good if you have plenty of friends to play with, but what if you don't? 
            The game has a few modes to play as a quick distraction, like a 1 vs 100 mode, but besides that, there's not much to do.
            There is a 24 hour story mode... but there's little to no story to speak of here, and it's pretty much just nonstop gimmick fights with the occasional puzzle that can be done in 2 minutes to break it up.</p>

            <p>You could try to go online to find matches, but that raises it's own problems. It's incredibly laggy for starters, to the point where it's an entirely different game (expect to see nonstop campers, like Samus).
            But also because of how it handles rulesets, you can make your own, but so can your opponent. So expect to see either a lot of competitive rulesets or a lot of bad rulesets from people desperate to move up the ranked ladder
            (Which there's no way to turn off, the ranked and unranked modes are blursed into one).</p>
            
            <h1>Verdict</h1>
            <p>I consider this to be a game of extremes, it's a pretty flawed time on your own, but nonstop fun with friends in person. However, whether you're looking for a "celebration of gaming" or a fun game to play with friends, 
            I'd still recommend this game. There will be something here for you somewhere, if you're willing to take a few roadbumps here and there.</p>
