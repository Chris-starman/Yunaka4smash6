            <h1>The objective top 10 Nintendo Switch games of all time</h1>
            <h2>Agree or perish</h2>
        </header>
            <p>It's no secret that the Nintendo Switch is very much on it's way to being the most sucessful console ever in gaming history. 
                Part of that is because it's a hybrid console, so it's perfect for letting you take the fun with you, anytime, anywhere. But the other is that it has a slew of fantastic games, 
                from already-record beating 1st parties in several genres, to a lot surprisingly high quality 3rd party ports like <i>Doom</i>,<i>Witcher 3</i>, and even <i>Skyrim</i>. 
                And they just kept coming month after month</p>
            
            <p>With the Nintendo Switch being more than 7 seven years old and with a backwards compatible sequel on the horizon, this begs the question: 
                what games should a person buying the sucessor get if they somehow missed out on the first Switch? There'll always be someone who missed out on the original, so what should they go back and give a try? 
                Come find out this retrospective.  </p>

<p>Euler's Equation</p>


<p>Me + u = I(<var>x</var>) = <var>e</var><sup>(ix)</sup></p>

<p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, 
and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
the identity</p>

<p><var>e</var><sup>(π<var>i</var>)</sup> + 1 = 0</p>

<p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, π, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in
a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named 
Euler's Identity as the 
most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.</p>
