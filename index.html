            <h1>The objective top 10 Nintendo Switch games of all time</h1>
            <h2>Agree or perish</h2>
            
        </header>
            <p>It's no secret that the Nintendo Switch is very much on it's way to being the most sucessful console ever in gaming history. 
                Part of that is because it's a hybrid console, so it's perfect for letting you take the fun with you, anytime, anywhere. But the other is that it has a slew of fantastic games, 
                from already-record beating 1st parties in several genres, to a lot surprisingly high quality 3rd party ports like <i>Doom</i>,<i>Witcher 3</i>, and even <i>Skyrim</i>. 
                And they just kept coming month after month</p>
            
            <p>With the Nintendo Switch being more than 7 seven years old and with a backwards compatible sequel on the horizon, this begs the question: 
                what games should a person buying the sucessor get if they somehow missed out on the first Switch? There'll always be someone who missed out on the original, so what should they go back and give a try? 
                Come find out this retrospective.  </p> 
            
            <h3 style="font-size:30px"><strong>#10 Xenoblade Chronicles 2</strong></h3>
            <p><img src="Xenoblade-Chronicles-2-Desktop-Wallpaper-620x349.png"></p>
            
            <p>Xenoblade Chronicles is an huge open world RPG in the vein of something like <i>Skyrim</i>, and it usually has one motto: "if you can see it, you can go to it." Sound familar?
             This is because the franchise inspired the juggernaut <i>The Legend of Zelda- Breath of the Wild</i>, who uses the same mentality. </p>

            <p>What the game trades in world size, it more than makes up with characters, soundtrack, content, and an extremely engaging battle system and world. 
               With all of that serving as frosting for the cake that is the game's story. Being a game all about what would happen if humanity lived on the backs of titans and if those landmasses started become all the scarcer. </p>

          

            <p> While it's augment equipping gacha system isn't for everyone, and the tutorials are terrible. If you give the game a chance you find out why Nintendo was so keen on having its makers:
            <strong><u>Monolith Soft</u></strong>, help out on just about every major 1st party Switch game.  </p>

            <h4 style="font-size:30px"><strong>#9 Metroid Dread</strong></h4>
            <p><img src="dread1.jpg"></p>

            <p>In especially the modern gaming space it's rare for a game that's been in devolpment for at least 10 years to see the light of day at all, 
                but it's even rarer for it to come out feeling like the game we just never got 15 years ago. </p>

            <p> Dread is a lot like <i>Doom Eternal</i>, sporting faster than ever combat, intutive controls, 
                and an immersive atmosphere (only helped by the jump in power), which all makes you <i>feel</i> like the cool bounty hunter we all know and love Samus for being. 
                This is immportant as the threat level has gone up with it, featuring segments where you'll have to face untouchable killer robots named EMMI, that'll literally give you a run for your money.  </p>

            <p>While Metroidvania fans might be a bit disappointed with the lack of backtracking, 
              and newcomers might be a bit put of by how hard the bosses and occassionally tricky puzzles, this is absoulutely a game everyone should try at least once.</p>

<h1>Now will THIS work?</h1>

<p>Euler's Equation</p>


<p>Me + u = I(<var>x</var>) = <var>e</var><sup>(ix)</sup></p>

<p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, 
and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
the identity</p>

<p><var>e</var><sup>(π<var>i</var>)</sup> + 1 = 0</p>

<p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, π, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in
a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named 
Euler's Identity as the 
most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.</p>
