            <p>Anyone remember how <i>Punch-Out</i> on the Wii? Well, imagine making a stretching that into a game with projectiles and there you have ARMS. It's an Arena Fighter 
            that'll have you competing in matches to bob and weave around long, stretchy, colorful punches, or thowing your own to avoid wide, stretchy grabs. Whatever I did, it always kept me coming back for more.</p>

            <p>ARMS is an incredibly easy game to pick-up and play with very no complicated combos or tech, being a lot like <i>Smash Bros.</i> in that way. And like that game, there's several control options avaiable, 
              from a single joy-con, to a pro controller, to even double joy-cons with motion control options. With these you get the option to throw to punches at the same time with more control on each. 
              I found myself not doing huge swipes and swings, but instead subtle jabs with this setup.</p>
